# Testing

This guide describes the test suite for `azure-functions-validation`, including how to run tests, the structure of the test suite, and guidelines for contributing new tests.

## Overview

The `azure-functions-validation` project maintains a high standard of quality through a comprehensive test suite. The suite ensures that request validation, response serialization, and decorator behavior work correctly across different Python versions and Azure Functions scenarios.

- **Total Tests**: 145+
- **Code Coverage**: 99%
- **Supported Environments**: Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14

The test suite covers unit tests for individual modules, integration tests with real Azure Function handlers, and smoke tests using the provided examples.

## Running Tests

The project uses `pytest` as its primary testing framework. You can run the tests using `make` targets or directly via `hatch`.

### Using Makefile

The simplest way to run tests is using the provided `Makefile` targets:

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run tests and generate a coverage report
make cov
```

The `make cov` command generates a terminal report, an XML report for CI integration, and a detailed HTML report in the `htmlcov/` directory.

### Direct Commands

If you prefer to run commands manually via `hatch`:

```bash
# Run all tests with verbose output
hatch run test

# Run tests with coverage
hatch run cov
```

To pass specific arguments to `pytest` (e.g., to run a single test file):

```bash
hatch run pytest tests/test_pipeline.py
```

## Test Structure

Tests are located in the `tests/` directory and organized by the functional area they cover:

| File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `test_decorator.py` | Validates configuration-time errors when applying `@validate_http`. |
| `test_pipeline.py` | Tests the runtime behavior including parsing, validation, and response building. |
| `test_errors.py` | Focuses on the error module and default error formatting logic. |
| `test_integration.py` | End-to-end tests using real Azure Function handlers and request objects. |
| `test_examples.py` | Smoke tests that verify the code snippets in the `examples/` directory. |
| `test_public_api.py` | Verifies the public API surface and export stability. |
| `test_adapter.py` | Tests the adapter layer responsible for interacting with Azure Functions types. |
| `test_placeholder.py` | Minimal sanity check for the test environment. |

The `tests/_test_app/` directory contains a sample Azure Functions application used by the integration tests to verify decorator behavior in a realistic environment.

## Test Organization

Tests are generally organized into classes to group related functionality and share logic. Common patterns include:

- `TestSuccessfulValidation`: Verifies that valid requests result in successful processing and correct responses.
- `TestValidationErrors`: Verifies that invalid input (body, query, path, headers) results in the expected 422 Unprocessable Entity responses.
- `TestAsyncHandlers`: Ensures that both synchronous and asynchronous Azure Function handlers are supported correctly.
- `TestCustomErrorFormatter`: Validates that users can override the default error response format.
- `TestConfigurationErrors`: Checks that improper use of the decorator (e.g., conflicting parameters) is caught at decoration time.

## Fixtures

The project uses `pytest` fixtures to simplify test setup. The most important fixture is `mock_request_factory`.

### mock_request_factory

Located in `tests/test_pipeline.py`, this fixture provides a factory function to create mock `azure.functions.HttpRequest` objects. It allows you to specify the method, URL, body, and various parameters without manually setting up complex mock objects.

```python
def test_example(mock_request_factory):
    request = mock_request_factory(
        method="POST",
        body=b'{"name": "Alice"}',
        params={"debug": "true"}
    )
    # Use the mock request in your test
```

## Integration Test Patterns

### MockHttpRequest Class

For tests that require a more robust representation of a request than a simple `unittest.mock.Mock`, the `tests/test_integration.py` file defines a `MockHttpRequest` class. This class implements the `HttpRequest` interface, providing realistic behavior for methods like `get_json()` and `get_body()`.

This is particularly useful when testing how the validation layer interacts with the internal state of an Azure Functions request object.

## Writing New Tests

When contributing new features or fixing bugs, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Location**: Place unit tests in the file corresponding to the module being tested. If it's a new functional area, create a new `test_*.py` file.
2. **Naming**: Use descriptive names for test functions, starting with `test_`. Use class-based grouping for related tests.
3. **Mocking**: Use the `mock_request_factory` for unit tests. For integration tests that need to verify handler behavior, refer to the patterns in `test_integration.py`.
4. **Async**: If testing async functionality, mark the test with `@pytest.mark.anyio`.

Example of a new test:

```python
@pytest.mark.anyio
async def test_my_new_feature(mock_request_factory):
    @validate_http(body=MyModel)
    async def handler(req, body):
        return {"result": body.value}

    request = mock_request_factory(body=b'{"value": 42}')
    response = await handler(request)
    assert response.status_code == 200
```

## Coverage Configuration

Coverage settings are defined in `pyproject.toml`. The project tracks branch coverage to ensure all logical paths are exercised.

- **Source**: `src/azure_functions_validation`
- **Reports**: Terminal (missing lines), XML (for CI), and HTML.
- **Branch Coverage**: Enabled (`branch = true`).

You can view the coverage configuration under the `[tool.coverage.run]` and `[tool.coverage.report]` sections of `pyproject.toml`.

## CI Test Matrix

The test suite runs automatically on every pull request and push to the main branch. The CI matrix ensures compatibility across:

- **OS**: `ubuntu-latest`
- **Python Versions**: 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, 3.14

This is managed via the `.github/workflows/ci-test.yml` configuration.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Test Failures

- **PYTHONPATH Issues**: If tests cannot find the `src` or `examples` modules, ensure your environment is set up correctly. Running via `hatch run test` or `make test` handles this automatically via the `pythonpath` setting in `pyproject.toml`.
- **Pydantic Version**: The project supports Pydantic v2. Tests may fail if an older version of Pydantic is installed.
- **Async Setup**: Ensure `pytest-anyio` is installed and tests are correctly marked with `@pytest.mark.anyio`.
- **Missing Dependencies**: If you see import errors for `azure.functions`, ensure you have installed the development dependencies using `pip install -e .[dev]`.

## Real Azure E2E Tests

The project includes a real Azure end-to-end test workflow that deploys an actual Function App to Azure and validates HTTP endpoints.

### Workflow

- **File**: `.github/workflows/e2e-azure.yml`
- **Trigger**: Manual (`workflow_dispatch`) or weekly schedule (Mondays 02:00 UTC)
- **Infrastructure**: Azure Consumption plan, `koreacentral` region
- **Cleanup**: Resource group deleted immediately after tests (`if: always()`)

### Running E2E Tests

```bash
gh workflow run e2e-azure.yml --ref main
```

### Required Secrets & Variables

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` | Secret | App Registration Client ID (OIDC) |
