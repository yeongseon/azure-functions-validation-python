"""Internal schema utilities for the ``endpoint`` metadata namespace.

This subpackage ships the JSON Schema for the ``endpoint`` metadata namespace
and a small, dependency-free loader. Producer packages (this one,
``azure-functions-langgraph``, ...) write the ``endpoint`` payload; consumer
packages (``azure-functions-openapi``) read it. The schema is an **internal
conformance artifact of this package** used by its own tests to keep the
emitted dict from drifting; it is not published, dereferenced, or shared as a
runtime contract. The payload is a **versioned dict convention** and each
package owns its local conformance tests against it.

The schema JSON is distributed as package data and loaded via
:mod:`importlib.resources`, so it is importable at runtime without any new
runtime dependency. ``jsonschema`` is only required to *validate* payloads
against the schema and is a test-only dependency.

See ``docs/METADATA_SPEC.md`` for the full contract, version policy, and
canonicalization rules.
