# AGENTS.md

## Purpose
`azure-functions-validation` provides request and response validation for Azure Functions Python v2 applications using Pydantic.

## Repository Identity
- Project: `azure-functions-validation`
- Project type: Python library
- Runtime scope: Azure Functions Python v2 programming model
- Minimum supported Python: `3.11`
- Packaging: `pyproject.toml` with Hatch

## Read First
- `README.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`

## Working Rules

### Test Coverage
- Maintain test coverage at **95% or above** for committed changes and PRs.
- Run `hatch run pytest --cov --cov-report=term-missing -q` to verify before submitting changes.
- Any PR that drops coverage below 95% must include additional tests to compensate.
- Runtime code must remain compatible with Python 3.11+.
- Public APIs must be fully typed.
- `azure-functions` (>=1.17) is a required runtime dependency; import it directly. This library only runs inside an Azure Functions app, where the package is always present.
- Keep documentation examples, decorator behaviour, and tests synchronized.
- The version test in `tests/test_public_api.py` reads from `importlib.metadata` and needs no manual edits across releases.

### Documentation & Translations
- English (`README.md`) is the **canonical** source of truth for all documentation. Translated READMEs (`README.ko.md`, `README.ja.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`) are **best-effort**, community-maintained, and may lag the English source.
- Translation sync is **not** required in the same PR as an English change, and a PR is **never** blocked by translation drift. Update translations opportunistically; when you do, keep them faithful to the current English source.
- Each translated README carries a staleness banner linking back to the canonical English README. Keep that banner in place so readers always know the translation may be out of date.

## Issue Conventions

Follow these conventions when opening issues so the backlog stays consistent with sibling DX Toolkit repositories.

### Title

Titles for issues, pull requests, and commits follow the **Title Convention** in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md#title-convention), the single source of truth for the format and the allowed types.

### Body

Use the following sections, in order, omitting any that do not apply:

```
## Context
What problem this issue addresses and why now. Note the target release (e.g. vX.Y.Z) here if known.

## Acceptance Checklist
- [ ] Concrete, verifiable items.

## Out of scope
- Items intentionally excluded, with links to the issues that track them.

## References
- PRs, ADRs, sibling issues, external docs.
```

### Labels

- Apply at least one type label: `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, or `chore` (`ci`, `test`, `question` where they fit).
- Every new issue gets `needs-triage` (issue forms and the `Triage new issues` workflow add it automatically; add it yourself with `gh issue create --label needs-triage` when creating issues from a workflow). Leave it for the maintainer, who removes it after confirming validity, scope, type, and priority.
- Priority uses exactly one of `priority:critical` / `priority:high` / `priority:medium` / `priority:low`. Never write P0/P1/P2.
  - `critical` — fix now: security issue, data loss, broken released package, or blocked release pipeline.
  - `high` — address before the next planned release; serious impact or no reasonable workaround.
  - `medium` — normal planned work; a workaround exists or scope is limited.
  - `low` — opportunistic polish or non-urgent improvement.
- Priority may be provisional while `needs-triage` is present. An external contributor without label permissions should describe urgency in the issue body.
- Add `area:*` labels when they exist in the repository.
- Use `blocker` only when the issue blocks a release.
- There is no work-in-progress label. Open unfinished pull requests as Draft PRs, and link the issue with `Fixes #N` so its in-progress state shows on the issue.

### Umbrella issues

When splitting a large piece of work into focused issues, keep the umbrella open as a tracker that links each child issue with a checkbox; close it once every child is closed or explicitly deferred.

### Project management model

This repository is **issue-based, not milestone-based**. Track and group work using issues plus the existing label taxonomy — do **not** introduce parallel structures.

- Plan and group multi-issue efforts with an **umbrella tracker issue** (see above) plus the existing `priority:*` labels. Do **not** create GitHub Milestones — none exist by design, and their absence is an intentional signal, not an oversight.
- Do **not** invent new label taxonomies (e.g. `epic:*`, `vNext`, release-tag labels) to group work. Reuse `priority:*`, `area:*` (only where they already exist), and the umbrella issue. Propose any new label in discussion and wait for explicit approval before creating it.
- Treat optional or tentative suggestions ("we could…", "it might be nice to…", "maybe later") as **discussion, not a directive**. Confirm intent before making any structural change to how work is tracked (milestones, labels, project boards, issue hierarchies).
- Before adding any organizational structure, check whether the repository already has an established convention. A category being empty or unused (zero milestones, no `epic:*` labels) is evidence to follow the existing pattern, not to introduce a new one.

## Validation
- `make test`
- `make lint`
- `make typecheck`
- `make build`

## Release Process

Three tools, one job each. Nothing else participates.

| Tool | Owns |
|---|---|
| **Release Please** | version decision, `__version__`, `CHANGELOG.md`, Release PR, tag, GitHub Release |
| **GitHub Actions** | verification, real-Azure e2e, PyPI publish |
| **Hatch** | building the Python package (reads `__version__` from `src/azure_functions_validation/__init__.py`) |

- **Do NOT manually edit version strings, `CHANGELOG.md`, `.release-please-manifest.json`, or tags.** Release Please owns all of them. The public-API test reads `__version__` against `importlib.metadata.version(...)`, so no test changes are needed when bumping.
- Releases are driven by **Conventional Commits** on `main`, but only **user-facing** types cut one: `fix:` → patch, `perf:`/`revert:` → patch, `feat:` → minor, `feat!:`/`fix!:`/`BREAKING CHANGE:` → breaking. While this package is pre-1.0, `bump-minor-pre-major` keeps a breaking change on the `0.x` line.
- **`docs:`, `ci:`, `chore:`, `test:`, `build:`, `style:` and `refactor:` do not cut a release.** They are marked `"hidden": true` in `release-please-config.json`, which keeps them out of `CHANGELOG.md`; when a batch of commits contains nothing else, the release notes render empty and Release Please logs `No user facing commits found since <sha> - skipping` and opens no Release PR. Merging such a PR and seeing no version change is the intended outcome, not a broken pipeline. A breaking change still releases whatever its type is.
- There are **no release Makefile targets**. `make release-*`, `make changelog`, `make tag-release`, and `make publish-pypi` were deleted; a local `hatch publish` would have skipped every gate below.

### Flow

```
feat:/fix: PR merged into main
        |
  Release Please  ->  Release PR (version + CHANGELOG)
        |  maintainer reviews and merges
  tag vX.Y.Z + GitHub Release
        |
  publish-pypi.yml  (started by the tag)
        build -> lib-tests -> cookbook-smoke -> cookbook-host-smoke
              -> azure-e2e -> PyPI
```

1. Merge Conventional-Commit PRs into `main`. Release Please keeps an open **Release PR** showing exactly what the next release would be.
2. Merging that Release PR is the act of cutting a release.
3. Release Please tags the release commit and publishes the GitHub Release. The tag starts `publish-pypi.yml`.
4. Every verification tier runs in that one workflow. PyPI upload happens only if all of them pass.
5. Update `docs/changelog.md` separately if needed. It holds hand-maintained version history and migration notes, and Release Please does not touch it.

**Certification is an in-chain gate.** `azure-e2e` deploys to real Azure and runs the live e2e suite at the same ref being published, so it covers the exact published commit by construction. There is no separate certification step to dispatch, and no cross-run SHA or freshness matching to get wrong.

**`RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN` is load-bearing.** It is a fine-grained PAT stored as a repository secret. The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot trigger other workflows, which would leave the Release PR without the required status checks — permanently unmergeable — and would stop the tag from starting `publish-pypi.yml`. The PAT grants repository write only; PyPI upload uses OIDC Trusted Publishing and cannot be reached with it. **Fine-grained PATs expire**: when it does, no Release PR appears. Regenerate it and update the secret before the expiry date.

### Tiered runtime verification (what gates a release)

Every tier runs inside `publish-pypi.yml` on the tag, and **all of them gate the upload**:

| Tier | Catches |
| --- | --- |
| `build` | tag/`__version__` mismatch; produces the one artifact that is later uploaded |
| `lib-tests` | library unit regressions |
| `cookbook-smoke` | downstream import/registration drift (0.21.0 class) |
| `cookbook-host-smoke` | candidate wheel installs cleanly and a real `func` host + Azurite boots with it present, no cloud. NOTE: the cookbook HTTP examples do not import this package, so this is a host-boot smoke, **not** proof of this package's own runtime behavior (tracked separately) |
| `azure-e2e` | cloud-only drift — deploys to real Azure, runs the live e2e suite, uploads an `azure-cert` record |
| `publish` | uploads the exact artifact `build` produced; it never rebuilds |

### Pre-release dry run (recommended before merging the Release PR)

Reproduce the automated gate locally before merging the Release PR, so failures surface before a version is cut:

- Build the candidate: `make build` (produces `dist/*.whl`).
- In [`azure-functions-cookbook-python`](https://github.com/yeongseon/azure-functions-cookbook-python): `make install`, then install the candidate over the PyPI floor with `hatch run pip install --force-reinstall --no-deps <path-to-candidate-wheel>`, confirm `importlib.metadata.version("azure-functions-validation")` equals the tag, and run `hatch run smoke`.
- Reproduce the host-boot smoke tier: in the cookbook, with the candidate wheel installed, run `hatch run e2e tests/e2e/test_http_examples.py` (starts a real `func` host + Azurite). This confirms the candidate installs and the host boots with it present; it is the local stand-in for `cookbook-host-smoke` and must pass before tagging. NOTE: these HTTP examples do not import this package, so this is not a decorator runtime test — rely on `lib-tests` for `@validate_http` behavior.
- Treat any new `RuntimeWarning`/`DeprecationWarning` from `@validate_http` as release-blocking — the library surfaces decorator-order and API-drift problems as warnings, so a clean run (zero validation warnings) is part of the gate.
- If the cookbook pins a lower bound (`azure-functions-validation>=X.Y,<1`), bump it to the new minor in the same release PR so examples are tested against the version they advertise.

### Recovery
- **Any gate failed.** Nothing was uploaded, so the version is still free. Fix the cause and re-run the workflow on the same tag (`gh workflow run publish-pypi.yml --ref main -f tag=vX.Y.Z`), or fix forward on `main` and let the next Release PR cut a new version. Never move or reuse a tag.
- **A tag exists but was never published.** A valid resting state. Re-run publish, or abandon the version and let the next release take the following number.
- **Release PR stopped appearing.** First check that `RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN` has not expired. Then check for a stale `autorelease: pending` label on an already-merged Release PR — Release Please treats that as a release still in flight and will not open another. This failure is silent: the workflow still reports success.
- **Break-glass (automation unavailable).** Bump `__version__`, match `.release-please-manifest.json`, commit, tag, and push. The tag starts the same gated workflow — never bypass it.

## Golden Commands

Use Makefile entry points only. Do not bypass the Makefile in CI or contributor guidance.

| Purpose | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Environment setup | `make install` |
| Format code | `make format` |
| Check formatting (`src`, `tests`) | `make format-check` |
| Lint | `make lint` |
| Type check | `make typecheck` |
| Tests | `make test` |
| Coverage | `make cov` |
| Full validation | `make check-all` |
| Docs build | `make docs` |
| Package build | `make build` |

## Testing Rules

- Public APIs require tests.
- Bug fixes require regression tests.
- Representative and complex examples must remain smoke-tested.
- `make check-all` is the minimum merge gate.

## Commit Rules

Titles for issues, pull requests, and commits follow the **Title Convention** in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md#title-convention), the single source of truth for the format and the allowed types.

## Agent Rules

When using AI-assisted development:

- Prefer small, reviewable changes.
- Do not guess about behavior that can be verified.
- Keep repository structure aligned with sibling repositories.
- Update docs, examples, and tests together when behavior changes.

## Final Rule

If it is not automated, it will drift.
If it is not documented, it is not a stable rule.

## Merge Policy

- `main` requires a pull request, every required status check green, and all conversations resolved. It requires **zero approving reviews**: `yeongseon` is the only account with push access and GitHub forbids approving your own PR, so a required approval could only ever be met by an administrator bypass. The required checks are what guard `main`.
- **Never use `gh pr merge --admin` to skip a failing or pending required check.**
- Review is still expected, just not enforced. An AI review (`COMMENTED`) is not an approval.
- **Dependabot:** `pip` patch/minor updates auto-merge on green CI. `github-actions` updates never auto-merge — confirm each pinned SHA matches its claimed tag (`git ls-remote --tags <repo>`, compare against the dereferenced `^{}` commit) before merging. `dependabot-automerge.yml` enforces the split.
- If a second maintainer ever gets push access, raise the approval count back to 1.

## Branch Hygiene

- Merged PR branches are deleted automatically ("Automatically delete head branches" is enabled on this repository); keep that setting on.
- When merging from the CLI, always pass `--delete-branch` (e.g. `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch`) so the head branch is removed.
- Never delete `main` or `gh-pages`, and never delete a branch that still has an open PR.
- Run `git fetch -p` periodically to prune stale local tracking refs.
