# AGENTS.md

## Purpose
`azure-functions-validation` provides request and response validation for Azure Functions Python v2 applications using Pydantic.

## Read First
- `README.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`

## Working Rules

### Test Coverage
- Maintain test coverage at **95% or above** for committed changes and PRs.
- Run `hatch run pytest --cov --cov-report=term-missing -q` to verify before submitting changes.
- Any PR that drops coverage below 95% must include additional tests to compensate.
- Runtime code must remain compatible with Python 3.10+.
- Public APIs must be fully typed.
- No runtime dependency on `azure-functions` beyond what is required for type hints — keep imports optional where possible.
- Keep documentation examples, decorator behaviour, and tests synchronized.
- The version test in `tests/test_public_api.py` reads from `importlib.metadata` and needs no manual edits across releases.

### Documentation & Translations
- When a change touches `README.md` or any English documentation, update the translated READMEs (`README.ko.md`, `README.ja.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`) **in the same PR** so translations never drift from the English source.
- This applies to any code change that alters documented behavior, CLI output, or the ecosystem/package table — not just direct edits to prose.
- If a full translation cannot land in the same PR, add a short "translation pending" note to the affected translated file and open a tracking issue before merging.

## Issue Conventions

Follow these conventions when opening issues so the backlog stays consistent with sibling DX Toolkit repositories.

### Title

- Use Conventional Commit prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `build:`, `perf:`.
- Add a scope qualifier when it narrows the area: `feat(decorator):`, `docs(serializer):`, `refactor(merge):`.
- Keep the title imperative, under ~80 characters, no trailing period.
- Do **not** put `[P0]` / `[P1]` / `[P2]` (or any priority marker) in the title — priority lives in the body.

### Body

Use the following sections, in order, omitting any that do not apply:

```
## Priority: P0 | P1 | P2 (target vX.Y.Z, optional)

## Context
What problem this issue addresses and why now.

## Acceptance Checklist
- [ ] Concrete, verifiable items.

## Out of scope
- Items intentionally excluded, with links to the issues that track them.

## References
- PRs, ADRs, sibling issues, external docs.
```

### Labels

- Apply at least one of `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, `chore`.
- Add `area:*` labels when they exist in the repository.
- Use `blocker` only when the issue blocks a release.

### Umbrella issues

When splitting a large piece of work into focused issues, keep the umbrella open as a tracker that links each child issue with a checkbox; close it once every child is closed or explicitly deferred.

## Validation
- `make test`
- `make lint`
- `make typecheck`
- `make build`

## Release Process
- Version is managed via `hatch` (dynamic from `src/azure_functions_validation/__init__.py`).
- **Do NOT manually edit version strings.** Use the Makefile targets below. The public-API test reads `__version__` against `importlib.metadata.version(...)`, so no test changes are needed when bumping.

### Commands
- `make release-patch` — bump patch version, update changelog, tag, and push
- `make release-minor` — bump minor version, update changelog, tag, and push
- `make release-major` — bump major version, update changelog, tag, and push
- `make release VERSION=x.y.z` — set explicit version, update changelog, tag, and push
- `make tag-release VERSION=x.y.z` — create and push an annotated tag (used internally by release targets)

### Flow
1. `make release-patch` (or `-minor` / `-major`) on `main`
2. This runs: `hatch version` → `git commit` → `make changelog` → `git commit` → `git tag` → `git push`
3. Tag push triggers **Publish to PyPI** GitHub Actions workflow automatically.
4. Update `docs/changelog.md` separately if needed (different format from `CHANGELOG.md`).
