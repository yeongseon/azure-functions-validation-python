# Contributing Guide

We welcome contributions to the `azure-functions-validation` project.

## Branch Strategy

Use GitHub Flow and branch from `main`.

Recommended branch prefixes:

- `feat/` for new features
- `fix/` for bug fixes
- `docs/` for documentation-only changes
- `chore/` for tooling and maintenance
- `ci/` for workflow updates

## Development Workflow

1. Create a branch from `main`.
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```
2. Write code and tests.
3. Run the local quality gate.
   ```bash
   make check-all
   ```
4. Push and create a pull request.
   ```bash
   git push origin feat/your-feature-name
   ```

## Project Commands

```bash
make format      # Format code with ruff
make lint        # Lint with ruff
make typecheck   # Type check with mypy
make test        # Run tests
make cov         # Run tests with coverage
make check-all   # Run the full local gate
```

## GitHub Actions Pinning

All external `uses:` references in `.github/workflows/` MUST pin to a
full 40-character commit SHA with a trailing comment documenting the
released version or channel. Example:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@de0fac2e4500dabe0009e67214ff5f5447ce83dd # v6
```

This applies to first-party (`actions/*`, `github/*`, `azure/*`) and
third-party Actions alike.

**Rationale.** Mutable tags (including immutable-looking version tags
like `@v6.0.1`) can be retroactively moved by an attacker who gains
write access to the upstream repository. The
[`tj-actions/changed-files` compromise (CVE-2025-30066, March 2025)](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/03/18/supply-chain-compromise-third-party-tj-actionschanged-files-cve-2025-30066)
demonstrated this exact failure mode: ~23,000 repositories had their CI
secrets exfiltrated, and only workflows that pinned to a commit SHA were
safe. GitHub's own guidance now identifies SHA pinning as
[the only way to use an Action as an immutable release](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#using-third-party-actions),
and OpenSSF Scorecard's
[`Pinned-Dependencies` check](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md#pinned-dependencies)
flags anything weaker as Medium-risk.

Dependabot updates SHA-pinned references on the configured schedule and
keeps the trailing version comment in sync, so the human-readable
context never drifts from the pinned commit.

**Approved exceptions.** The following mutable refs are the only ones
permitted in this repository and are flagged with an inline comment at
the call site:

- `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1` — PyPA-maintained stable
  release channel; this pinning style is explicitly recommended upstream.
- Local composite actions (`uses: ./...`) — versioned with the repo.

When adding a new external Action, resolve the SHA with
`git ls-remote <repo-url> 'refs/tags/<tag>^{}'`. The trailing `^{}`
**dereferences** the ref to its target commit; without it, an
*annotated* tag returns the tag-object SHA instead of the commit SHA,
and the tag-object SHA is **not** a valid `uses:` target.

```bash
# Annotated tag — the two forms return *different* SHAs:
git ls-remote https://github.com/Azure/login 'refs/tags/v3.0.0' 'refs/tags/v3.0.0^{}'
# 93381592...   refs/tags/v3.0.0       <- tag object, do NOT pin to this
# 532459ea...   refs/tags/v3.0.0^{}    <- commit, pin to this one

# Lightweight tag — only the non-deref form returns a row, and it is
# already the commit SHA. Always include the `^{}` form anyway so the
# same command works for both tag types:
git ls-remote https://github.com/actions/setup-python 'refs/tags/v6' 'refs/tags/v6^{}'
```

Single-quote the `refs/...^{}` argument so the `{}` and `^` are not
interpreted by your shell (notably zsh with `EXTENDED_GLOB`).

## Example Coverage Policy

Examples are part of the supported API experience and should stay verified.

- Keep one representative example for the minimal validation workflow.
- Keep one complex example for custom error handling and multi-field validation.
- Add or update smoke tests whenever an example changes.
- Prefer lightweight smoke coverage over infrastructure-heavy end-to-end tests.

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

### Examples

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add OpenAPI 3.1 support"
git commit -m "fix: handle empty request body gracefully"
git commit -m "docs: improve quickstart documentation"
git commit -m "refactor: extract schema builder logic"
git commit -m "chore: update dev dependencies"
```

Use imperative present tense and keep the message concise.

## Deployment

- A merge to `main` triggers the production deployment workflow.
- Deployment status can be tracked from the related GitHub Actions run.
